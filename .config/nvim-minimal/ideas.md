# Ideas

## Short Tweaks
- Bind something to closing all windows but the current one
- Fix quick fix list forward and backward?

## Interesting
- Write a command 'back' which when run will cd into the 'home' directory of 
that tmux session. The home directory being the one chosen when using 
tmux sessionizer

## Plugin Ideas
- Just a simple dired file finder. Key features:
    - have it as one long path name that pops up, with autocomplete for the 
    next component in the file
    - the idea is to have less options on screen
    - backspace to go back one directory/clear the current input
